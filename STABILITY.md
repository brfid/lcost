# lcost stability contract

lcost has no external embedders today. This file is forward-looking: if a future tool wants to **vendor** small pieces of lcost rather than import it (the supported pattern — `import lcost` is not), this file pins the API shapes that vendor would copy, so internal refactors don't break it silently.

If you change anything listed here, bump the **STABLE_VERSION** below. Future embedders pin to a commit hash and the version number, and re-pin on drift.

```text
STABLE_VERSION = 1
```

## Scope

Stable for embedders means:

- Field names and types under the headings below won't change without a STABLE_VERSION bump.
- Internal module layout, function signatures, return shapes of helpers, CLI flags, and dashboard output **are not stable**. Don't `import lcost.<x>`; copy the small piece you need.

Out of scope (deliberately not stable):

- `lcost/collectors.py` function names and call sites.
- `lcost/dashboard/` rendering and HTML.
- `lcost/cli.py` flags and positional args.
- `pyproject.toml` extras / optional deps.

## Stable: pricing dictionary shape

Source: `lcost/lcost/pricing.py`.

Per-family pricing is a dict with these four keys, USD per **million** tokens:

```python
{
    "input":       float,  # base prompt tokens
    "output":      float,  # generated tokens
    "cache_write": float,  # cache_creation_input_tokens
    "cache_read":  float,  # cache_read_input_tokens
}
```

Family keys (lowercase, no provider prefix): `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`. Other Anthropic family keys may be added over time; existing keys won't change name.

Embedder cost formula (must match):

```
cost_usd = (input_tokens       * pricing.input
          + output_tokens      * pricing.output
          + cache_creation_in  * pricing.cache_write
          + cache_read_in      * pricing.cache_read) / 1_000_000
```

Current numeric values are **not** stable across releases (vendors will copy them at a pinned commit). The *shape* and the *formula* are.

## Stable: provider-prefix strip regex

Source: `lcost/lcost/collectors.py`.

To resolve a Bedrock model id (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7`) to a pricing family, strip a leading `<region>.<provider>.` prefix and substring-match the remainder for `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku`:

```
^(us|global|eu|apac|apne|apse)\.(anthropic|openai|amazon|meta|mistral|cohere|ai21|google|deepseek)\.
```

The list of regions and providers is append-only; existing entries won't be removed without a STABLE_VERSION bump.

## Stable: Claude Code transcript JSONL shape (read path only)

lcost reads the transcripts Claude Code writes at `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (incl. `*/subagents/*.jsonl`). Embedders that walk these files rely on:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "assistant",          // filter on this
  "timestamp": "2026-...Z",     // ISO-8601 UTC; Date.parse-compatible
  "message": {
    "model": "us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7",   // pass through prefix-strip + family match
    "usage": {
      "input_tokens":                <int>,
      "output_tokens":               <int>,
      "cache_creation_input_tokens": <int>,
      "cache_read_input_tokens":     <int>
    }
  }
}
```

Records with `type != "assistant"` or no `message.usage` are skipped. Other top-level fields (`uuid`, `parentUuid`, `sessionId`, ...) are not stable for embedders — don't depend on them.

This is upstream Claude Code's format, not lcost' invention. If Anthropic changes it, we ship a new STABLE_VERSION and embedders re-pin.

## Stable: Claude Code statusLine stdin shape (read path only)

The dict Claude Code feeds to a `statusLine` command on stdin. Embedders rely on these fields:

```jsonc
{
  "model":          { "display_name": "Opus 4.7",
                      "id":           "us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7" },
  "context_window": { "used_percentage": 3 },        // integer 0..100
  "cost":           { "total_cost_usd": 0.27 }       // float, current session
}
```

All other fields (`session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `workspace`, `version`, `output_style`, `effort`, `thinking`, ...) are not stable. Embedders should `JSON.parse` and degrade gracefully on missing fields.

This is also upstream's format. Same versioning rule.

## How embedders should pin

A vendoring embedder must:

1. Copy the constants/regex/formula it needs into its own source file.
2. Put a header comment naming this file and the **commit hash** of lcost at copy time.
3. Reference STABLE_VERSION in that comment.
4. On any drift between vendored copy and current lcost, update the copy and bump the pin in the same commit.

Example header for a vendored copy:

```text
# Vendored from lcost/lcost/pricing.py — DO NOT IMPORT lcost DIRECTLY.
# Source of truth: ~/src/lcost (commit <full sha>)
# Stability contract: ~/src/lcost/STABILITY.md, STABLE_VERSION = 1.
```

## Known embedders

None today. When one lands, append it here with the path and the pieces it vendors.
