"""Single-instance guard via an advisory lock on a PID file.

Prevents a second TUI from launching while one is already running —
e.g. an orphaned TUI from a closed terminal whose source files have
since moved, as happened with ai_cost_tracker.py.

Uses ``fcntl.flock`` (POSIX advisory), so the lock is released
automatically by the kernel when the process exits — even on ``kill
-9``. No stale-PID cleanup needed.
