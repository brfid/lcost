"""Ingest pipeline orchestration.

Coordinates collectors with ledger persistence. This sits above the
collectors layer because it owns cross-source decisions (which collectors
to invoke based on `source`) and ledger lifecycle (load state → collect →
merge → save).

Gap-triggered deep rescan: if more than `max_gap_hours` have passed since
the last successful ingest, per-file incremental offsets are discarded and
every discoverable session file is re-parsed from byte zero. Dedup by
msg_id in `ledger.ingest()` makes this safe. This is the safety net against
Claude Code's session cleanup — as long as you run lcost at least once
per CC retention window, nothing is lost.
